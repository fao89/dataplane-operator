= Deploying the data plane

[role="_abstract"]
You use the `OpenStackDataPlaneDeployment` CRD to configure the services on the data plane nodes and deploy the data plane. Create an `OpenStackDataPlaneDeployment` custom resource (CR) that deploys each of your `OpenStackDataPlaneNodeSet` CRs.

.Procedure

. Create an `OpenStackDataPlaneDeployment` CR and save it to a file named `openstack-edpm-deploy.yaml` on your workstation.
+
----
apiVersion: dataplane.openstack.org/v1beta1
kind: OpenStackDataPlaneDeployment
metadata:
  name: openstack-edpm-ipam
spec:
  nodeSets:
    - openstack-edpm-ipam
    - <nodeSet_name>
    - ...
    - <nodeSet_name>
----
+
* Replace `<nodeSet_name>` with the names of the `OpenStackDataPlaneNodeSet` CRs that you want to include in your data plane deployment.

. Save the `openstack-edpm-deploy.yaml` deployment file.

. Deploy the data plane:
+
----
$ oc create -f openstack-edpm-deploy.yaml
----
+
You can view the Ansible logs while the deployment executes:
+
----
$ oc get pod -l app=openstackansibleee -w
$ oc logs -l app=openstackansibleee -f --max-log-requests 20
----

. Verify that the data plane is deployed:
+
----
$ oc get openstackdataplanedeployment
NAME             	STATUS   MESSAGE
openstack-edpm-ipam   True     Setup Complete


$ oc get openstackdataplanenodeset
NAME             	STATUS   MESSAGE
openstack-edpm-ipam   True     NodeSet Ready
----
+
For information on the meaning of the returned status, see xref:ref_data-plane-conditions-and-states_dataplane[Data plane conditions and states].

+
If the status indicates that the data plane has not been deployed, then troubleshoot the deployment. For information, see xref:proc_troubleshooting-data-plane-creation-and-deployment_dataplane[Troubleshooting the data plane creation and deployment].

. Map the Compute nodes to the Compute cell that they are connected to:
+
----
$ oc rsh nova-cell0-conductor-0 nova-manage cell_v2 discover_hosts --verbose
----
+
If you did not create additional cells, this command maps the Compute nodes to `cell1`.

. Access the remote shell for the `openstackclient` pod and verify that the deployed Compute nodes are visible on the control plane:
+
----
$ oc rsh -n openstack openstackclient
$ openstack hypervisor list
----
